We welcome contributions to CombatWeaponry++! To ensure smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

## Pre-commit hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run checks on your code before you commit. Please install and set up pre-commit by following the instructions on their website. This helps maintain code quality and consistency.

## Code style

(Coming Soon) Make your code follows the style defined in `.editorconfig` and passes Checkstyle checks. More details will be provided here once implemented.

## Git commit messages

Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Please observe the following:

*   **Subject line:** Keep the subject line concise, with a hard limit of 60 characters and a soft limit of 50 characters.

## Recipe changes

When making changes to recipes, please ensure that the functionality remains consistent with the original repository: <https://github.com/soupeater333/Combat-weaponry-plus-plugin-minecraft>. While your implementation may differ, the end result and behavior of the recipes should be functionally identical.
