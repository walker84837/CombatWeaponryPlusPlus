# CombatWeaponry++

A major and comprehensive refactor of [CombatWeaponryPlus](https://github.com/soupeater333/Combat-weaponry-plus-plugin-minecraft), but:
- more maintainable
- future-proof
- fit to work on 1.21

> [!WARNING]

>
> Running it on your server may cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or data loss. Please wait for the official `2.0.0` release before using it in any environment you care about.
